# N3 - Network Nick's Notes

## About Me

Hi, I'm Nick and I design, build, install, deploy, and manage networks and SDN services. You can find me crafting bespoke SDN blends of IaaS, network design and engineering, with DevOps to automate configuration, documentation, policies, procedures, operations, deployments, monitoring, and management of services, systems, routing, switching, and path-based networks. I specialise in diverse multi-homed BGP deployments and accompanying essential network services including dual-stack anycast DNS authoritative and recursive resolver clusters with NTP, SMTP and http/https/h2 reverse proxy API and CDN deployments that operate with high-availability in harmony with the network, and scale with it too.
